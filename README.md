# Hydra Syntax Theme
![Inspiration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juanmnl/hydra-theme/master/hydra.png)

Hail Hydra!  
While trying to stay on the hydra's aesthetics side, I will continue to improve this theme based on user feedback and my own research. Main goals will always be readability and long-term usage.  

You can help develop this theme further by contributing to the github repo.  

Cheers! :)  

**Use with Atom's One Dark UI theme.**
